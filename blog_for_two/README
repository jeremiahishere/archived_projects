Blog For Two

Create posts about events and let other writers tell their story too.

To Do:
- Fix the posts controller
  - only need access for debugging problems (admin only)
- Add image uploading attached to posts
  - create a post image model with paperclip attachments
  - add nested model javascript to create multiple photos
- Add your events page
  - list events that you have not posted on
  - list events that other people have recently posted on
- Major graphical overhaul
  - turn it purple
  - style the event_posts partial to a blog format
